## Setting Up

Please take a look at the following document for environment setup, creating branch, and making pull request.

- [How to Submit the Assignment](../doc/submit.md)

In this assignment, it is necessary to install [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library. 
Please follow the following document for setting up.    

- [How to set up the Eigen Library](../doc/setup_eigen.md)  


Additionally, you need the newest versio of the library [DelFEM2](https://github.com/nobuyuki83/delfem2) in `pba-<username>/3rd_party` . Please keep this library installed and updated by. 

```bash
$ cd pba-<username> # go to the top of local repository
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/delfem2
```

(DelFEM2 is a collection of useful C++ codes written by the instructer.)



## Problem1

Build the program using `cmake`. Run the program and take a screenshot image of the window. (You will probably see some *undesirable* animation and that's OK). Paste the screenshot image below by editing this mark down document:

## Problem 2

This program tries to solve the deformation of static mass-spring system by energy minimization using Netwon's method. However, unfortunately, the current implementation does not converge because the computation of the hessian of the spring's enegy is incomplete. 

- The springs energy can be written as `W=1/2(len-Len)*(len-Len) = 1/2C*C`, where `len` is current and `Len` is rest length and `C=(len-Len)`.
- Gradient can be written as `dW=C*dC` that is already implemented
- Hessian can be written as `ddW=dC*dC+C*ddC`. In the current code, `ddC`is not computed yes (set to zero) and thus the Newton's iteration does not converge. 

Fill the code around line #56 to compute the correct hessian of the energy (about 6-8 lines of simple codes). If the optimization works well, the energy should steadily decrease and converges within 10 iterations.

Paste the screenshot image of converged deformation below:
