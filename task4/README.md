Additionally, you need the library [DelFEM2](https://github.com/nobuyuki83/delfem2) in `pba-<username>/3rd_party` 

```bash
$ cd pba-<username> # go to the top of local repository
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/delfem2
```

(DelFEM2 is a collection of useful C++ codes written by the instructer.)



## Problem1

Compile the `main.cpp` using the `cmake` on the `CMakeLists.txt` . Run the program and take a screenshot image of the window appeared. Paste the screenshot image below.

## Problem 2

Using the **Sort & Sweep Method**, implement the fast collision detection between the circles. Make the color of the collided circles  red. This can be done by setting `true` the `is_collided` member variable of the `CCircle` class. Implementation should be just adding 5 -10 lines of code around line #135 of `main.cpp`.  Use the function `is_collide()` at line #102. Take a screenshot image and paste it below.
